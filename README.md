# Career Guide
All of us need guidance and help from time to time. But when it comes to specific goals and ambitions, getting this help becomes difficult. This is what Career guide is for. It is an AI powered platform which analyses your goals and tries to provide you a concrete path to achieve them. It is not just limited to career goals but can be used everywhere - personality goals / financial goals / health goals etc.
